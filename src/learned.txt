Destructuring:
    This is called a "destructuring". Actually, you're passing an object as an argument to the function, but the destructuring uses only the named properties of the object.

    const destructuring = ({ used }) => console.log(used);
        
    const properties = {
    unused: 1,
    used: 2,
    };

    destructuring(properties); // 2
